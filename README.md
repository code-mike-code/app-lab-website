# Project task-02 - Responsive Web Design (RWD)

See the live version of [Responsive Web Design (RWD) project](https://code-mike-code.github.io/project-02/).

Project made during learning process with my mentor program [devmentor.pl](https://devmentor.pl/). This project emphasizes Responsive Web Design (RWD), ensuring seamless adaptability across various devices and screen sizes. Built with HTML5 semantics, the structure is clean, accessible, and aligned with modern web standards. The styles leverage CSS3 basics to deliver a visually appealing and efficient design. Additionally, the BEM methodology ensures the CSS is modular, maintainable, and easy to scale for future development.

**Main features**:
- HTML5 semantics
- CSS3 basics
- RWD (responsive web design)
- BEM methodology

This project incorporates clamp() for responsive font sizing, providing a seamless and dynamic typography experience. By defining a minimum, preferred, and maximum size, clamp() ensures text adjusts fluidly across different screen sizes while maintaining readability. This approach enhances design flexibility and eliminates the need for complex media queries, streamlining the responsive design process.

## 💭 Conclusions for future projects

For future projects, integrating modern techniques like clamp() for responsive typography will enhance design scalability and adaptability across devices. Continued use of BEM methodology ensures maintainable and modular CSS for streamlined collaboration and updates. Emphasizing tools like SCSS and task runners such as Gulp will optimize workflows, saving time and improving project efficiency.
